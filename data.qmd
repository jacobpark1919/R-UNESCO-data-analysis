### Data Background

Our team utilized three main datasets for our analysis:

World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE): Available at the World Inequality Database on Education, the WIDE database compiles data from various reliable surveys and assessments, offering insights into the impact of different inequality factors on educational outcomes. Its goal is to highlight significant educational disparities across and within countries to aid in policy-making and public discourse.

Country Mapping - ISO, Continent, Region: This dataset was obtained from Kaggle, a platform offering a wide range of free data resources. It was created for mapping countries in the dataset creator's analysis, and she permits its free use. The variables in this dataset are straightforward, naming countries with their ISO codes and categorizing them into different continents, regions, and sub-regions. For instance, Afghanistan is represented as AFG - Asia - Southern Asia.

PISA Scores by Country 2024: Sourced from the World Population Review, this dataset is part of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). PISA assesses the educational performance of 15-year-old students across approximately 80 countries through a two-hour test focused on science, reading, and mathematics. The dataset provides average scores in these subjects, reflecting the educational standards and economic success indicators of the participating countries.

The following are the relevant variables for the chosen dataset.
name: Names of the country. 

region: The continent in which the country is located.

sub-region: The specific region of the continent in which the country is located. 

OverallPisaScore2022: Total Pisa scores of the country in 2022.

PISAScoresMathScore2022: The Pisa scores in math of the country in 2022.

PISAScoresScienceScore2022: The Pisa scores in science of the country in 2022.

PISAScoresReadingScore2022: The Pisa scores in reading of the country in 2022.

literacy_1524_no: Percentage of young people aged 15‐24 who can read a simple sentence.

comp_prim_v2_m: Percentage of (i) children and young people aged 3‐5 years above primary school graduation age and (ii) young  people aged 15‐24 years, who have completed primary school. 

mlevel1_m : Passing rate of Level 1 Math Test.

mlevel2_m: Passing rate of Level 2 Math Test.

mlevel3_m: Passing rate of Level 3 Math Test.

eduyears_2024_m: Average number of years of schooling attained for the age group 20–24 years.

eduout_prim_m: Percentage of children of primary school age who are not in school. 

comp_lowsec_v2_m: Percentage of (i) young people aged 3‐5 years above lower secondary school graduation age and (ii) young  people aged 15‐24 years, who have completed lower secondary school.

preschool_3_no: Percentage of 3 to 4 year olds attending any type of pre–primary education programme. 


### Data loading and grouping

[clean_script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R%60)

The libraries we use:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(scales) 
# For formatting and manipulating axis labels and color scales in plots.
library(patchwork) 
#Facilitates the combination of multiple ggplot2 plots into one.
library(knitr) 
#Enables dynamic report generation integrating R code with text.
library(stringr)
#Provides easy-to-use functions for string operations.
library(car)
# Offers tools for regression diagnostics and other statistical tests.
library(caret)

```

To enhance our data preparation process, we plan to refine the regional categorization within our dataset. Initially, we identified that the 'region' column unexpectedly amalgamated diverse regions, such as combining Europe with North America and East with Southeast Asia. To address this, we will adopt a strategy to split the data more accurately according to geographic regions. We have sourced an additional dataset that delineates regions and continents more distinctly. By integrating this new dataset with our original data, we will reorganize the regional variables for clearer segmentation. Following these adjustments, we will conduct data visualization on the newly grouped data. This step will facilitate a deeper understanding and provide clearer insights by representing the data in a visually intuitive manner.

We try to merge PISA and region dataset, so it can allow us for exploring how educational outcomes vary across different regions, and we can analyse  the influence of regional contexts on educational difference with data.
