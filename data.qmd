This comes from the file `data.qmd`.

Your first steps in this project will be to find data to work on.

I recommend trying to find data that interests you and that you are knowledgeable about. A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.

Initially, you will study *one dataset* but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components.

## What makes a good data set?

-   Data you are interested in and care about.
-   Data where there are a lot of potential questions that you can explore.
-   A data set that isn't completely cleaned already.
-   Multiple sources for data that you can combine.
-   Some type of time and/or location component.

## Where to keep data?

Below 50mb: In `dataset` folder

Above 50mb: In `dataset_ignore` folder. This folder will be ignored by `git` so you'll have to manually sync these files across your team.

### Sharing your data

For small datasets (\<50mb), you can use the `dataset` folder that is tracked by github. Add the files just like you would any other file.

If you create a folder named `data` this will cause problems.

For larger datasets, you'll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named `dataset-ignore`. This will be ignored by git (based off the `.gitignore` file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github's size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in `dataset-ignore` are synced across team members.

Your [load_and_clean_data.R](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R) file is how you will load and clean your data. Here is a an example of a very simple one.

```{r}
source(
  "scripts/load_and_clean_data.R",
  echo = FALSE # Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output  
)
```

You should never use absolute paths (eg. `/Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/` or `C:\MA415\\Final_Project\`).

You might consider using the `here` function from the [`here` package](https://here.r-lib.org/articles/here.html) to avoid path problems.

### Load and clean data script

The idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them. This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis. Note that you don't need to run this script from every post/page. Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which could be plain text files or `.RData` files. In your data page you'll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes. To link to this file, you can use `[cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R)` wich appears as [cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R).

## Rubric: On this page

You will

-   Describe where/how to find data.
    -   You must include a link to the original data source(s). Make sure to provide attribution to those who collected the data.
    -   Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don't know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.
-   Describe the different data files used and what each variable means.
    -   If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.
-   Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
    -   You *must* include a link to your `load_and_clean_data.R` file.
    -   Rrename variables and recode factors to make data more clear.
    -   Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.
    -   Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.
    -   Some repetition of what you do in your `load_and_clean_data.R` file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.
-   Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
    -   Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.
    -   This page should be self-contained.

### Data Backgroud

The dataset provided by the World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE) tracks educational disparities across various countries, including the United States.

https://www.education-inequalities.org/countries/united-states

From the 212,969 rows and 86 columns, it provides data on education outcomes differentiated by wealth, gender, ethnicity, and location, among other factors. This database can be significant for analyzing racial disparities in education. Meanwhile, the dataset provides numerous variables such as income, region, and completions of education which enable us to perform variable selection to find the best variable to show the correlation between racial disparities and education.

We used two data sets so far. We mainly focused on the education dataset which includes many education-related variables that are used to assess various aspects of educational attainment and attendance rates across different levels of schooling, from pre-primary to upper-secondary education. Examples of the variable and its definition: comp_prim_1524_m refers to the Percentage of young people aged 15‐24 years, who have completed primary school; comp_upsec_2029_m refers to people aged 20‐29 years, who have completed upper secondary school; eduout_upsec_m refers to Percentage of youth of upper secondary school age who are not in school. (WHO defines 'Adolescents' as individuals in the 10-19 years age group and 'Youth' as the 15–24 years age group.) Our data is mainly focused on education access and completion conditions by categorizing different demographics such as sex, ethnicity, location, region, wealth, and speaking language at home. The data also combined those categories to narrow down the group and get the education data. For example, we had the category of “Location & Sex,” which groups data with either Rural or Urban, each further grouped by either female or male. Thus, we have four different groups of data: Rural-Female, Rural-Male, Urban-Female, and Urban-Male. However, to avoid overfitting the model or processing duplicate data, we may filter the data by a single category of either one of the “Location”, ”Sex”, “Ethnicity”, ”Region”, “And wealth,” discarding other combined ones. For response value, we will keep those variables about the access and completion rate and remove those indicators about learning indicators such as learning achievement in reading/mathematics/science because there are a lot of missing values. For future analysis of education based on race, we also used another dataset that contains the name of the country, the country code, the central region (e.g. Asia), and its sub-region (e.g. Southern Asia) in order to regroup the area in the education data set.

### Data loading and grouping

`[script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R)`

The libraries we use:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(broom)
```

To enhance our data preparation process, we plan to refine the regional categorization within our dataset. Initially, we identified that the 'region' column unexpectedly amalgamated diverse regions, such as combining Europe with North America and East with Southeast Asia. To address this, we will adopt a strategy to split the data more accurately according to geographic regions. We have sourced an additional dataset that delineates regions and continents more distinctly. By integrating this new dataset with our original data, we will reorganize the regional variables for clearer segmentation. Following these adjustments, we will conduct data visualization on the newly grouped data. This step will facilitate a deeper understanding and provide clearer insights by representing the data in a visually intuitive manner.

```{r}
continent <- continent|>
  rename(
    country = name
  )
continent

merged_data <- merge(data, continent, by = "country")

merged_data <- merged_data |> rename(sub_region = `sub-region`)
```
