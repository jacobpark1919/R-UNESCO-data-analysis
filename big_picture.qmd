Education stands as a cornerstone of societal development and individual opportunity, yet across the globe, disparities in access and quality paint a troubling picture. Our extensive data analysis reveals interesting insights about where these educational disparities are, and why they may occur

*Thesis:* By analyzing extensive education data, we will be able to identify where educational disparties are, and answer the question of why these disparities exist. On top of answering these quesitons, we will use the power of this dataset to create actionable insights that have have the power to make a change.

## What did we find?

### Africa was the worst perfromer by almost every metric

We looked at many metrics that all aim to measure the education level of a country in some capacity. This includes PISA scores, literacy rates, primary school completion rate, mean years of education, etc. What we noticed in essentially all of these metrics that Africa was the worst performer in every category. However, the concerning part is that it was not even close. Africa consistently lagged behind the rest of the continents.

### While Africa is the worst performer, Nortern Africa is performing a lot better than Sub-Saharan Africa.

When analyzing the primary school completion rate for Africa as a continent, we found that as the worst performer by far. But when we took a deeper dive, we found that Northern Africa was actually on par with the rest of the world in terms of this metric, where as Sub-Saharan Africa significantly lagged behind the rest of the world. This is true for many other metrics as well.

***So what does this mean?*** Common perception tells us that Africa as a continent is behind in education, but that statement is only partially correct. When breaking down these metrics by region rather than continent, we can tell that This is more of a Sub-Saharan African issue rather than an African issue. Many countries in Africa, such as Nauru (NER), Chad (TCD), and Libera (LBR), have less than 25% of their kids complete primary school, which is a shockingly low number. Rather than labeling Africa continent that is behind in terms of quality education, we should be more-so focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa as a region that needs better education.

### Keep your kids in school at all costs

Much of our analysis was focused on metrics involved with staying in school. Metrics such as primary school completion rate, mean years of education, percentage of people not in school, etc, all fall into this category. We have also analyzed benchmark metrics such as academic achievement, literacy rates, and PISA scores. Our analysis makes it clear that *there is an extremely strong correlation* between these schooling metrics such as primary school completion rate and mean years of education, and the benchmark metrics such as PISA scores and literacy rates.

```{r}
#| label: lin reg
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

countries_to_label <- c("India", "Chile", "Niger", "Chad", "China")

edu <- merged_data4 |>
  group_by(country) |>
  summarise(mean_year_educ = mean(eduyears_2024_m, na.rm = TRUE),
            literacy = mean_literacy_rate) 

label_data <- edu %>%
  filter(country %in% countries_to_label)

ggplot(edu, aes(x = mean_year_educ, y = literacy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_text(data = label_data, aes(label = country), vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5) +  
  labs(
    x = "Mean Years of Education",
    y = "Literacy Rate",
    title = "Mean Years of Education vs. Literacy Rate",
    subtitle = "Each point represents a country"
  )
```

***So what does this mean?*** This plot tells us that how long you stay in school is directly correlated with a benchmark metric such as literacy rate. The number one most important thing when it comes to school is that you are at least attending school. Of course doing well and getting good grades should be a big goal too, but attending school in the first place is extremely important.

### Europe is doing a great job and the world should model after them

On the other side of things, we noticed that Europe was the best performing continent in almost every metric. The suprising part is that Europe Europe does not really have any countries that are significantly behind any other countries. In section 1.5 of our analysis, we looked at the worst 3 countries in each continent for each metric, and Europe's "worst" countries still outperformed the average countries in other continents. For example, when analyzing the primary school completion rate, the country with the lowest completion rate in Europe, Albania, still had a rate of 0.97, which is significantly higher than every other country in that table.

***So what does this mean?*** This tells us that the world could benefit form modeling its education systems after Europe. European education systems typically receive substantial government funding, which ensures high quality teaching and resources.

### Impact of Geographic and Socioeconomic Factors on Secondary Education Completion

Our have revealed critical insights into the factors influencing secondary education completion rates, particularly in the regions of Africa and South America. Findings indicate that residing in rural areas, being in lower wealth brackets, and being located in Africa significantly hinder secondary education achievement. Conversely, high rates of primary education completion have been shown to positively impact secondary education success.

Furthermore, the attendance at pre-primary institutions also boosts secondary education completion rates, demonstrating the importance of early childhood education. Interestingly, a surprising trend was observed where less than two years of schooling could still enhance literacy among youth aged 15-24, enabling them to read simple sentences. This intriguing correlation suggests that even minimal education can contribute to basic literacy skills, though further research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.

These insights are crucial for policymakers and educational organizations aiming to improve education systems and tailor interventions that support educational attainment across varying socioeconomic and geographic landscapes.
