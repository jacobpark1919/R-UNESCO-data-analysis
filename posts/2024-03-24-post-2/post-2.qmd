## Data background:

The data originates from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and other national household surveys and learning assessments across over 170 countries.The data originates from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and other national household surveys and learning assessments across over 170 countries.The data was jointly maintained and developed by the Global Education Monitoring Report and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics through their partnership.when we are trying to look at the education data from the different regions grouped, such as North America and Europe, East and Southeast Asia… We thought the grouping was not reasonable because, for example, the education systems of North American and European countries are very different, and even the countries within the European continent have distinct education systems. Thus, we may consider regrouping the data by Country.

For the sample population, each sample represents the data of a community in a country, and the data about the education may be categorized by different categories such as ethnicity alone, location alone, and ethnicity & location combined. There are 50 categories in total so we are able to draw maps, charts, infographics and tables from the comprehensive dataset.As mentioned above, the data are collected to achieve the goal of SDG 4 and Target 4.5 which commit to eliminate all kinds of disparities in education and provide as equitable education opportunities as possible.

The organization assists international governments in investing in science and technology, developing science policies, and evaluating the ways scientific research can aid in a country’s development and sustainability practices.Thus, the dataset helps support all kinds of research, and it helps making policy decisions on education, technology and all related fields to achieve the goal.

## Data Loading and Cleaning:

To enhance our data preparation process, we plan to refine the regional categorization within our dataset. Initially, we identified that the 'region' column unexpectedly amalgamated diverse regions, such as combining Europe with North America and East with Southeast Asia. To address this, we will adopt a strategy to split the data more accurately according to geographic regions. We have sourced an additional dataset that delineates regions and continents more distinctly. By integrating this new dataset with our original data, we will reorganize the regional variables for clearer segmentation. Following these adjustments, we will conduct data visualization on the newly grouped data. This step will facilitate a deeper understanding and provide clearer insights by representing the data in a visually intuitive manner.

## Data for Equity:

The definition of beneficence in the “Principles for Advancing Equitable Data Practice”, basically call people in data processing to maximize benefits for all human beings and avoid causing harm. In our project, we want to discuss the relationship between race and education. Recognizing our topic is full of sensitivity and complexity, we will ensure our analysis is fair without reinforcing any stereotypes to some races and regions. In order to follow beneficence, we will be meticulous in how data is interpreted and presented, and avoid making incorrect or harmful interpretations. Our data set we chose actually aligns with the principles. For example, the original data can be accessed through the websites of the Global Education Monitoring Report and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. The website is accessible for all communities and it follows the principle of justice: return data and research results to community members in a form they can use. Concurrently, it also meets transparency, because to adhere to this principle, it would entail providing comprehensive metadata and ensuring easy access to data documentation. However, our dataset encompasses numerous variables, not all of which are pertinent to our analysis.  The presence of superfluous information poses a risk of leading to incorrect conclusions or oversimplifications. Additionally, there may be challenges due to our limited capacity to fully analyze the breadth of data available. By acknowledging these limitations and proceeding with caution, we aim to uphold the principles throughout our research.
